# APIBolt

APIBolt is an open-source REST API testing platform and a lightweight alternative for API development, though still progressing with more features.

Currently, it is limited to REST API testing and manual testing, but it is planned to support GraphQL, gRPC, and other protocols.

It features module-based testing and automatic code generation for almost 25+ languages. It is highly inspired by modern development tools like VS Code, offering extensive customization options like themes, shortcut mapping, and layout customization. We also have a separate theme marketplace where developers can share their custom themes.
