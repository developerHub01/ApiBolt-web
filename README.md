# APIBolt

Api bolt is a open-source REST API testing platform light alternative of Postman, though still progressing with more features.

Currently it is limited with REST API testing and manual testing, but it is planned to support GraphQL, gRPC, and other protocols.

But still have module based testing and automatic code generation for almost 25+ languages. And most interesting part is, it is highly inspired from Postman and VS-code with my own creativity. So as inspired from VS-code so I tried to implement some of the customization options like themes, shortcuts mapping, layout customization, etc. Even we have a separate theme marketplace offered by many developers who are contributing their themes for free.
